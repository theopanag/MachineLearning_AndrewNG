A repository with implementations of certain exercises in Python. The exercises are from the assignments of the excelent corresponding course in Coursera by Andrew NG.The exercises were originally designed to be implemented in Octave/MatLab. All datasets used, have been retrieved from the course material.

[Exercise 4 - Neural Networks Learning](exercise 4/Programming Exercise 4 - Neural Networks Learning.ipynb)
[Exercise 5 - Regularized Linear Regression and Bias VS Variance](exercise 5/Programming Exercise 5 - Regularized Linear Regression and Bias vs Variance.ipynb)
[Exercise 7 - K-means Clustering and Principal Component Analysis](exercise 7/Programming Exercise 7 - K-means Clustering and Principal Component Analysis.ipynb)
[Exercise 8 - Anomaly Detection and Recommender Systems](exercise 8/Programming Exercise 8 - Anomaly Detection and Recommender Systems.ipynb)
